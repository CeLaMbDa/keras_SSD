# SSD in Keras
  Here, thanks @rykov8 gave a excellent implementation of SSD in Keras, some part of this implementation comes from his.
  But in my implementation, there's some novel things, just like using loop structure to generate prior boxes instead of using numpy matrix operation. 
  But this is the first object detection algorithm to a new in computer vision area, so if you see this, just think this is a joke, because I didn't even finish it's training on PASCAL VOC2007.
